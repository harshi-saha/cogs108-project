    " When food enters the body, it is broken down into sugar (glucose), which is then absorbed by cells to use as energy.

Diabetes is also linked to increased HbA1c, which refers to the amount of red blood cells coated in glucose as a result of sugar in the bloodstream (5). Factors like age, bmi, and smoking can affect the risk of developing diabetes, and men are also more likely to have diabetes than women (6, 7, 8). \n",

    "Since diabetes is a very common illness there have been many research studies associated with its risk factors. Previous research study that synthesized multiple data sources and analysis found that there are many different risk factors of diabetes. Some of these risk factos are alcohol consumption, tobacco use, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood pressure, stress, hereditary conditions, and demographics. Overall, they found that the two most influencing factors to developing diabetes are Triglyceride (TG) and hemoglobin (A1C), both heavily influenced by BMI. (1) Other studies seems to agree with this finding. In a study that used logistic regression and classification tree to predict diabetes, the researchers found that the most influential factors in predicting diabetes are BMI, pedigree, and glucose. Using these 3 main features both models were able to achieve accuracy of 78% and 74% respectively. (2) Another study utilized various analysis methods (bivariate Pearson Analysis, network analysis, ROC analysis) and concluded that out of all of the features BMI was the most influention in predicting Diabetes. Furthermore, it also found high colinearity between diabetes, BMI, cholestrol, HbA1c, and age, as well as some other features used in the study. (3) It seems that most of the studies agree that BMI, family history and glucose levels are good predictors of diabetes. BMI appears to be the most influential one, but it also seems to have a relationship with other features. Based on this information we want to further explore if one feature can be predicted by another and whether this differs for those with and without diabetes.\n",
